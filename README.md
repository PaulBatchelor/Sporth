# Sporth

Sporth (short for SoundPipe fORTH), is a small stack-based musical language, roughly
inspired by stack languages like Forth and PostScript.

## Features

- Stack oriented paradigm
- Written entirely in C
- 100+ unit generators to choose from
- Powered by the Soundpipe DSP library
- Unix-Friendly
- Small codebase
- Powerful C API
- Easily extendable
- Easily embeddable


## Installation

In order to compile Sporth, The development "dev" version of [SoundPipe](http://www.github.com/PaulBatchelor/soundpipe.git)
needs to be installed.
**When you clone soundpipe, be sure to use the 'dev' branch of soundpipe with 'git checkout dev'.**
*Note: The development branch of Soundpipe is used because on any given day, there are
more modules there than in the master branch. More modules = more fun :)*

Then:

1. make
2. sudo make install

## Quick start

To see Sporth in action, run this command from the inside the project directory:

```
sporth -d 5s -o dialtone.wav examples/dialtone.sp
```

This will generate a 5 second audio clip of sound.

## Examples

Several examples demonstrating specific ugens can be found in
the [examples](examples) folder of the repository. More musical
examples can be found on the
